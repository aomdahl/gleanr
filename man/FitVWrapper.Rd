\title{Wrapper for the V function, not serving a purpose at the moment.}
\usage{
FitVWrapper(X, W, W_c, U, option, formerV = NULL, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{X}{the matrix to be decomposed (N x T, N is the number of data points, T is the number of features)}

\item{W}{the weight matrix, same size as in X, containing standard errors of the GWAS estimates}

\item{U}{learned loading matrix  (N x K, N is the number of data points, K is the number of factors)}

\item{option}{list of all option settings (accesses V, LD, gls,
actively_calibrating_sparsity, posF, regression_method, epsilon,traitSpecificVar,intercept_ubiq)}

\item{formerV}{Optional argument to pass in previous iteration of V as prior to next one.}
}
\value{
List containing the new V ("V") and the sparsity upper limits for each regression steps ("sparsity_space")
}
