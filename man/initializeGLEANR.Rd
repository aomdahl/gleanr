  trait.names,
  K = 0,

}
\arguments{
\item{X}{NxM matrix of SNP effect sizes}

\item{C}{\itemize{
\item cohort overlap estimates
}}

\item{snp.ids}{\itemize{
\item list of SNP ids, corresponds to order in Xâˆ‚
}}

\item{trait.names}{\itemize{
\item trait names to use, corresponds to order in X
}}

\item{K}{\itemize{
\item specify a K if you would like.
}}

\item{covar_shrinkage}{Degree of shrinkage towards the identity. matrix to apply to C (0 means none, 1 means perfect shrhinkage.) If covar_se is not NULL, defaults to the variance based (Strimmer) approach}

\item{enforce_blocks}{Force the matrix to be block matrix, default TRUE}

\item{covar_se}{Matrix of standard errors corresponding to C. Used for shrinkage. If given, covar_shrinkage defaults to "STRIMMER"}

\item{...}{}

\item{W-}{weights from Standard errors}

\item{init.mat-}{which matrix to initialize to}
}
\value{
a list containing the objects needed to run gleaner, including the decorrelating transformation matrix andthe options matrix.
